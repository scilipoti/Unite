Need enough food to support population or they die

Make food number red when going down
give ten second warning before workers start to die of starvation

fade in buildings and buttons only just before they can be built. very simplistic at first.
never fade in more than 2 or 3 at a time. but have a button to show all

have a notification section like EU4 for worker starvation, choices, etc

a sense of scale. how big is the village really?

resource requirements on hover
show which resources you have enough of in green, not enough in red

no upgrades, upgrades are stupid and annoying.

show composition of resource rates on hover

order distribution bar by size

add a notification when a new citizen arrives
